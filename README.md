# Doom Engine (Renderer) in Python (For mice!)

## Built with
- Python 3.7.1
- pygame, numpy, pyopengl, pillow

Thanks to the great work done by jordansavant, based on the this doom engine I was able to recreate a virtual representation of the labyrinth used for study of mice behavior, first described in this research article: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66175

## Changes that were made: 
-Changed all walls in the labyrinth to a shade of gray
-Increased the resolution to 1280x720 
-Removed all other resources in the respitory and left the bare minimum for the program to run

## Running DIY DOOM
- Support efforts of original project (this is a port from C++ to Python: https://github.com/amroibrahim/DIYDoom)
- Get a DOOM WAD file. Comes with any original install of Doom or Doom 2.
- Put wad file in `wads/` dir
- Run with `python3 main_diy.py wads/DOOM.wad [map]` where optionally `[map]` is a doom map name: eg `E1M1`
